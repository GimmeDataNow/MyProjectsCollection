# The skills I learned
### routers
> In order to set up my WLAN for my home, I had to buy and set up my own router. Having been provided a static IP, I learned how set up my network. I first learned the different operation modes (Router | Access) and their purpose. Afterwards I was introduced into static IPs and some of the important parameters that surround it ( IP, subnet mask, default gateway, etc.).  Having entered my static IP, I was introduced to the split between WAN and (LAN + WLAN). I learned of DHCP and it's importance in a network. I configured the DHCP server with an IP address pool and reserved some IPs for some certain devices, and then bound these devices to the corresponding IP.

I learned about routing in my local network, static ip and dynamic ip, routing and dhcp, mac addresses, LAN and WAN
### docker
I learned about virtualization, docker, docker-compose, docker-stacks and environments using portainer as my docker manager. 
### pihole and routing
I learned about networking, ip addresses (ipv4 and ipv6), domains, DNS, DNS filtering, 
### nginx-proxy-manager
I learned about port-forwarding, http and https, ssl, proxy, reverse proxy, 404 Hosts, redirection host
